1
00:00:01,183 --> 00:00:03,117
Previously on Prison Break:

2
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:06,070
There's something about this guy.

3
00:00:05,963 --> 00:00:07,954
He knows where we're going,
what we're thinking.

4
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:11,603
It's a matter of time before
he finds out about the money in Utah...

5
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:14,744
...and our way into Mexico, everything.

6
00:00:21,403 --> 00:00:23,837
You can have an attorney present
during questioning.

7
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,507
Caroline, they're taking her in.
Of course. I'II keep an eye on her.

8
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:28,742
I did it, Dad.

9
00:00:28,854 --> 00:00:30,321
Just do as you're told.

10
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:34,544
Otherwise, there will be consequences
that will affect us all.

11
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:36,119
My dad's an Air Force colonel.

12
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:41,848
When I told him I was staying in a hotel
with a guy that I maybe sort of Iiked...

13
00:00:42,897 --> 00:00:44,125
...he Iost it.

14
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,940
-What're you doing here? Where's Maricruz?
-She's with me.

15
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:51,331
-Just tell me where she is.
-Hey, Fernando, slow down, man.

16
00:00:51,314 --> 00:00:53,874
I was trying to tell you
the wedding is in Vegas.

17
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:58,738
-So which one of them it was it?
-Might be Scofield.

18
00:00:58,884 --> 00:01:00,875
Probably gonna find his brother
in there too.

19
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:05,720
-Where to, sir?
-Utah.

20
00:01:13,335 --> 00:01:16,964
This morning, authorities in Illinois issued
an update on the escaped convicts...

21
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:19,762
...known, until now,
as the Fox River Eight.

22
00:01:19,973 --> 00:01:21,838
Chicago mob boss John Abruzzi...

23
00:01:21,858 --> 00:01:24,952
... was gunned down outside
a Washington, D. C. motel last night...

24
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:28,120
...after investigators received
a tip from an informant.

25
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:32,202
The other seven escapees are still at large
and considered dangerous.

26
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,279
A Florida man wanted in--

27
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:39,070
I didn ' t think Abruzzi'd
be the first to eat it.

28
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:42,091
I have a feeling
we're in for Iots of surprises.

29
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:46,171
They said seven are still out there.
So much for faking our deaths.

30
00:01:46,364 --> 00:01:49,060
I bought us some time.
That's what counts.

31
00:01:51,914 --> 00:01:54,314
-How much further?
-Seventy, 80 miles.

32
00:01:55,387 --> 00:01:58,049
Means we should be hitting
Double-K Ranch by this afternoon.

33
00:01:57,669 --> 00:01:59,933
We could keep driving,
pick up L.J. and hit Panama.

34
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:03,712
We can't hit Panama. We can't hit anything.
We can't do anything without the money.

35
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,380
We need to find Charles' stash.

36
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:11,335
I know some other guys
who are thinking the same thing.

37
00:02:13,498 --> 00:02:19,322
The money is buried under a silo
at the Double-K Ranch...

38
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:24,927
...just outside of Tooele, Utah.
There's $5 million there.

39
00:02:40,538 --> 00:02:41,800
Tickets.

40
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:47,333
You know, when I was in Cheyenne,
I pulled my ticket out of the bag.

41
00:02:48,185 --> 00:02:51,814
It tore in half, and I have no idea
what happened to the other part.

42
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:54,234
-They didn't issue you a replacement?
-No.

43
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,896
The young Iady,
I think her name was Sherry...

44
00:02:56,886 --> 00:03:00,219
...she actually said that this half was okay
because the barcode was on it.

45
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:02,381
Well, you really need the whole ticket.

46
00:03:02,518 --> 00:03:05,214
This is exactly
what I was trying to avoid.

47
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:07,088
She said everything
would be fine because--

48
00:03:07,624 --> 00:03:08,989
That's okay. It'II do for now.

49
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:12,845
But make sure you ask for a replacement
when you get to Provo.

50
00:03:12,284 --> 00:03:14,809
I definitely will. Thank you.

51
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,794
-It's always something, huh?
-Oh, God, I know.

52
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,642
I don't wanna go home.

53
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:36,096
I wish we could keep driving.

54
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:39,547
I don't think your pops
will be down for that.

55
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:42,032
Wouldn't it be fun?

56
00:03:42,977 --> 00:03:46,469
We could go to Hawaii.

57
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:50,282
-No, you can't drive to Hawaii.
-I know.

58
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:50,523
I know.

59
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:54,398
I'm just saying, I wish.

60
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:01,540
-No, don't get it. They'II Ieave.
-Just Iet me see who it is.

61
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:09,095
It's a cop.

62
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:11,040
No, no, no.

63
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,099
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.
Have you happened to see this person?

64
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:25,492
Season 2
Episode 5
Map 1213

65
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:58,415
Last night, we got a few phone calls
that he was spotted in the area.

66
00:04:58,521 --> 00:04:59,749
So we're going door to door.

67
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,648
Why are you Iooking for him?

68
00:05:02,686 --> 00:05:05,246
He escaped from prison in IIIinois
a couple of days ago.

69
00:05:05,677 --> 00:05:07,304
Have you seen him?

70
00:05:11,783 --> 00:05:13,341
No.

71
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,305
He doesn't Iook familiar.

72
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,924
Are you sure?

73
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:20,936
Yeah, I'm sure.

74
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:25,192
AII right. Thanks for your time.

75
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:36,730
This ain't--
This is not what you think, all right?

76
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:42,953
Look, trust me. Just Iisten, okay?

77
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:49,052
AII I did was steal a baseball card, okay?
I'm not Iike those other fools up in there.

78
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:54,483
I'm gonna go for a walk, okay?

79
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:56,596
I'm gonna Ieave my keys right here.

80
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,865
And when I come back,
my car will be gone.

81
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:07,197
I'm sure in a few hours,
they'II find it somewhere...

82
00:06:07,656 --> 00:06:09,055
...abandoned.

83
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:15,365
Wait, wait.

84
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:23,522
I wish it could be different.

85
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:27,094
I have to go.

86
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:50,528
-Tooele.
-I think it's "Tooele."

87
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:52,923
-Hell of a town.
-Small is good.

88
00:06:53,322 --> 00:06:55,051
Means the ranch'II be easier to find.

89
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:57,424
AII we gotta do is get that money...

90
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:00,982
-...and be out of here by nightfall.
-Nice.

91
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:24,627
Oh, sir. Soil tests came back
from Scofield's crash.

92
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:28,712
Not that you need any more proof,
but he really went out of his way this time.

93
00:07:29,183 --> 00:07:30,741
What else do you have?

94
00:07:30,668 --> 00:07:34,695
A man was assaulted in Nebraska by
a hitchhiker matching Bagwell's description.

95
00:07:34,844 --> 00:07:38,302
He was headed west on the I-80.
Omaha's putting together a photo Iineup.

96
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:40,295
What do you have on Scofield?

97
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:43,228
What does anybody have on Scofield?

98
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,227
I've got some results from his hard drive.
The one recovered from the river.

99
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,846
We were able to use the sector editor
to restore the master boot. So from that--

100
00:07:54,597 --> 00:07:56,758
I don't care how you did it.
What do you have?

101
00:07:59,233 --> 00:08:02,930
More than half the contents of the buffer.
About 60 percent.

102
00:08:08,628 --> 00:08:12,120
-It Iooks pretty random.
-Print it up, all of it. I want it on my desk.

103
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:18,292
Well, guess what.

104
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:20,599
No Iisting for a Double-K Ranch.

105
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:24,504
Excuse me. You know where
I might find the Double-K Ranch?

106
00:08:24,548 --> 00:08:26,982
-What'd you call it?
-Double-K Ranch.

107
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,107
-No.
-You from around here?

108
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:30,704
Yeah. Born and raised.

109
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:32,722
There's no double nothing.

110
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,264
Great. Thank you.

111
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:39,932
Looks Iike Westmoreland spent
his Iast breath blowing smoke up your ass.

112
00:08:40,143 --> 00:08:41,440
There's one way to find out.

113
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:44,310
The county keeps property records.

114
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:47,838
Every plot is mapped out with dimensions.
It's public record.

115
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:51,948
But if there
is a tax assessor's office here...

116
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,084
...it's gonna be in there.

117
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:56,601
In the municipal building.

118
00:08:57,363 --> 00:08:59,923
Lot of cops in there, Michael.

119
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,445
-Dispatch.
-Someone....

120
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,145
Someone stole my car this morning.
I'm at the Lotus Motel off Interstate 80.

121
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:14,723
-Did you see who took it?
-No. I went out for a walk.

122
00:09:14,694 --> 00:09:18,721
-And when I came back, it was gone.
-This morning? Why didn 't you call before?

123
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:20,273
I don 't know.

124
00:10:18,516 --> 00:10:21,542
-Mr. Kellerman.
-Mr. Kim.

125
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:26,443
-Surprised to see you in Chicago.
-Just Iooking for updates.

126
00:10:26,407 --> 00:10:27,874
Sara Tancredi. I'm on it.

127
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:32,258
-Is pursuing her the best use of your time?
-It is.

128
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:34,333
She's in contact with Scofield.
I was there when he called yesterday.

129
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,081
We stay with her, she takes us right to him,
he takes us to Burrows.

130
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:42,410
AII right.

131
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:44,437
-If you're that confident.
-I am.

132
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,674
-I'II Iet the president know.
-I contact the president directly.

133
00:10:51,308 --> 00:10:52,673
I'II contact her.

134
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:56,191
Keep me posted.

135
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:25,337
If you wanna restore dignity,
you need to take action.

136
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,847
Making amends requires much more
than saying, "I'm sorry. "

137
00:11:30,216 --> 00:11:32,275
It means Iearning to change.

138
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:35,048
The apology's just the first step.

139
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:38,107
The most important thing
is that you display honesty...

140
00:11:38,113 --> 00:11:42,848
...courage and compassion
when you extend your apologies.

141
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:46,754
You need to earn your forgiveness.

142
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,644
We'II talk about it more on Friday.

143
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:06,586
-I got a great idea.
-What's that?

144
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,427
Since you are such a fan of Iame,
store-bought blueberry pie...

145
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:14,987
...I'm gonna bake you
a real pie of your choice tonight.

146
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:19,575
I can't.

147
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:23,128
I really don't need to be seeing anyone
right now who isn't my therapist.

148
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:27,786
I've been a hermit Iately too.

149
00:12:28,906 --> 00:12:30,567
My partner Daniel's away on business.

150
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:32,571
I've been sitting around
every night by myself.

151
00:12:33,863 --> 00:12:35,854
Kind of pathetic.

152
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:39,183
I'm so sorry. I thought you meant....

153
00:12:41,732 --> 00:12:42,960
I thought....

154
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,760
-The pie....
-Oh, no.

155
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:51,671
-No, I was really talking about--
-Pie?

156
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:55,440
Yeah, actual blueberries. Like we'd make pie
and watch Fried Green Tomatoes.

157
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:59,290
-I get it. I get it.
-I'm the best ex-junkie cook in this town.

158
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,550
Thank you. I just--
I gotta clean my apartment.

159
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,079
It's disgusting.
I realize that sounds Iike an excuse.

160
00:13:05,348 --> 00:13:07,316
-It's not.
-No, no, no, I get it.

161
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:09,093
You do what you gotta do.

162
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:11,410
Have a good night.

163
00:13:14,072 --> 00:13:15,767
You deliver?

164
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,799
Next batch.

165
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:59,216
Just put it on the desk.

166
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:04,496
-Any of this stuff mean anything?
-I don't know. Ask me Iater.

167
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:05,687
Is he a genius or a whack job?

168
00:14:05,917 --> 00:14:08,044
We answered that
when we assigned 1 00 agents.

169
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:10,453
So why don't you go
get me the rest of it?

170
00:14:10,338 --> 00:14:11,737
Does that work for you?

171
00:14:44,531 --> 00:14:47,466
AIackaday.

172
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:49,353
I just found me an in-betweener.

173
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,466
-Where you going in such a hurry?
-None of your beeswax, yo.

174
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:56,236
I know where.

175
00:14:56,448 --> 00:14:59,440
The same place as every other man
that was in that room that night.

176
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:04,623
They all coming around here for a big
family reunion at the Ku KIux Ranch.

177
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:06,563
If they ain't here already.

178
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:09,454
There ain't no fool in this town
ever heard of the Double-K Ranch.

179
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,410
It seems Iike you been misinformed.
There is a Double-K.

180
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,489
It's just a matter of who gets there first.
The stars are gonna collide in Tooele.

181
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,664
You'II need me on your side.

182
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,804
This ain't Fox River, all right?
I don't need any--

183
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,389
As you can see...

184
00:15:27,012 --> 00:15:28,639
...I need you.

185
00:15:30,532 --> 00:15:33,797
Get your grubby paws off me, you freak.

186
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,758
I ain't your ditch digger.

187
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:38,075
I don't need nothing from you.

188
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:39,364
I don't need nothing.

189
00:15:39,857 --> 00:15:41,324
You might.

190
00:15:42,214 --> 00:15:45,513
If a man knew where he was
supposed to be Iooking....

191
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:01,256
Hi.

192
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,403
Are you having the Hector Avila
and Maricruz Delgado wedding today?

193
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:08,358
Avila. No? Thanks.

194
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:20,243
Hi. Are you having the Hector Avila
and Maricruz Delgado wedding today?

195
00:16:21,043 --> 00:16:22,476
Avila.

196
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:25,750
Delgado.

197
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:27,441
Really?

198
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,918
When?

199
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:42,741
Stay calm. We'II be out of here
in 1 0 minutes.

200
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:46,485
One at a time.

201
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,660
CIear. Back up.

202
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:55,433
You wearing a watch?

203
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:57,486
Yeah.

204
00:17:09,503 --> 00:17:11,300
Nice day.

205
00:17:13,247 --> 00:17:14,908
Thanks.

206
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:28,541
This is exactly what we need.
It's a map of every parcel of Iand.

207
00:17:28,633 --> 00:17:31,796
Topography, buildings, everything.

208
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:37,442
Karl Kokosing. Double-K.

209
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,654
I don't Iike the way
this guy's Iooking at us.

210
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,494
Twelve-thirteen.

211
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:56,232
Where's 1 21 3?

212
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:07,080
-Hey, Seifert. I need to speak with you.
-Come on, man. We gotta roll now.

213
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:11,107
-Hey, Seifert.
-Come on. You got the map?

214
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:17,463
No.

215
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:19,900
Someone else does.

216
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:33,444
Someone got here before us.
It's the only explanation.

217
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:41,272
Son of a bitch is still alive.

218
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:46,745
-Hey, pretty.
-What the--?

219
00:18:46,482 --> 00:18:48,712
What you gonna do, scream?

220
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:52,910
How the hell are you still breathing?

221
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,127
What the helI'd you do to your hand?

222
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,596
Easy, easy.

223
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:01,282
I recently had some work done.

224
00:19:01,336 --> 00:19:02,894
Where's the map?

225
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:08,092
Easy, easy, easy. I don't have it.

226
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,288
-Well, where is it?
-I'm telling you, I don't have it.

227
00:19:11,863 --> 00:19:15,060
-Don't have it, huh?
-You were there. We saw you.

228
00:19:14,776 --> 00:19:17,336
It was gone. Why don't you keep
your pooch away from me?

229
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:20,118
I'II tell you everything I know.

230
00:19:23,073 --> 00:19:25,303
It's the kid. He has it.

231
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:27,539
I saw him this morning.

232
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:30,299
I needed some help.
We made a deal, all right?

233
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:34,194
He said that he would dig.
I told him where we could get a map at.

234
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:36,492
What kid?

235
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,222
What kid?

236
00:19:52,836 --> 00:19:55,031
The best thing to do is nothing.

237
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:58,189
That's how I'II get the U.S. Senate
to confirm my vice-presidency?

238
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:00,279
-Do nothing?
-Shows them you can do the job.

239
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:04,393
Wait a minute. It's my daughter.

240
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:08,021
Sir, we need to talk about your daughter.

241
00:20:08,503 --> 00:20:09,731
What about her?

242
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:12,451
Well, the media
is all over this Fox River situation.

243
00:20:12,748 --> 00:20:16,081
We think it would be best
if you could distance yourself from her--

244
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:19,856
If I hear this one more time....
I paid her bail. I walked away.

245
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:22,162
I have distanced myself.

246
00:20:25,713 --> 00:20:27,681
Give me a minute.

247
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:32,577
Hey, Dad, it's me.

248
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:36,346
When you get a chance, I really need
to talk to you about some things.

249
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,690
Actually, a Iot of things.

250
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:42,870
The most important one is that...

251
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,640
...I owe you an apology.

252
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:49,335
I realize that I've made things
difficult for you Iately.

253
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:56,466
And I wanna take responsibility for that.

254
00:20:57,918 --> 00:21:00,284
Call me back. Bye.

255
00:21:01,765 --> 00:21:04,859
-Hi. I know I'm early, but I brought dinner.
-Come on in.

256
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:07,538
-You're not a vegetarian, are you?
-No.

257
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,613
Just shut that behind you.

258
00:21:21,027 --> 00:21:23,552
-Do you mind if I check my e-mail?
-No, not at all. Here.

259
00:21:23,527 --> 00:21:25,825
-Oh, you're so kind. Thank you.
-Absolutely.

260
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,398
-Do you happen to have a pen handy?
-Yeah.

261
00:21:53,032 --> 00:21:55,125
Thank you so much.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

262
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:59,697
-No, Iook, I have a Iittle pencil and pad.
-Thank you.

263
00:22:06,873 --> 00:22:09,706
-Sir. Sir.
-Yeah?

264
00:22:08,596 --> 00:22:10,029
No Sherry in Cheyenne.

265
00:22:10,673 --> 00:22:12,368
Your ticket is not valid for travel.

266
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:16,366
Oh, well, hold on, now.
That can't be right. That can't be right.

267
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:17,900
-Excuse me for a second.
-Sure.

268
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:23,546
AII right, now, Iisten, brother,
I'm gonna give it to you straight up.

269
00:22:23,426 --> 00:22:25,257
Seriously, I don't-- I'm broke, okay?

270
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:27,287
Now, that's the truth.

271
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,088
Now, I just ran into some trouble
a while back.

272
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,038
I'm just trying to pull it all together now.
You understand?

273
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:37,930
Well, you can tell that to the authorities
in about five minutes.

274
00:22:38,341 --> 00:22:40,866
Come on, brother,
we don't have to get the authorities--

275
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,015
It's too Iate.

276
00:22:42,484 --> 00:22:44,418
They're already waiting at the next stop.

277
00:22:44,494 --> 00:22:47,827
These guys here are gonna sit with you
until we stop.

278
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:52,794
I understand. I understand.

279
00:22:59,565 --> 00:23:01,999
-Hey!
-Come here.

280
00:23:02,312 --> 00:23:04,246
-Sir.
-Hey, you can't go in there.

281
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:09,172
Oh, my goodness.

282
00:23:25,609 --> 00:23:28,203
Okay, we've got a confirmed sighting
on Franklin.

283
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:30,815
He jumped out of a moving train
in Preston, Idaho.

284
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,027
What is a black man from Chicago
doing in Idaho? He's gotta be Iost.

285
00:23:36,077 --> 00:23:38,102
Franklin's in Preston,
Bagwell's in Nebraska.

286
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:40,609
Both men have never been
across the Mississippi.

287
00:23:40,646 --> 00:23:42,841
Visiting friends and family?
I don't think so.

288
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:45,592
And not south of the border.

289
00:23:46,088 --> 00:23:51,458
They're due west,
and we need to know why.

290
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:54,782
Out.

291
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,238
-What's going on?
-Where'd you say Tweener was headed?

292
00:23:59,186 --> 00:24:01,916
Up on the main drag.
He's supposed to find a shovel.

293
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:10,521
-In.
-No.

294
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:12,785
-No, no, no.
-In.

295
00:24:18,596 --> 00:24:21,724
You're coming back, right?
You're coming back?

296
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,810
-Yep.
-Hey, you guys.

297
00:24:24,693 --> 00:24:26,217
Hey.

298
00:24:26,822 --> 00:24:29,222
Come on, man. I'm boiling up in here.

299
00:24:40,554 --> 00:24:43,887
I was on my ATV and I was hauling ass.
I was right on her tail.

300
00:24:43,841 --> 00:24:46,139
I pulled out my gun and...that bitch
treed herself.

301
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,533
And I brought her down in one shot.

302
00:24:48,518 --> 00:24:50,713
-What'd she weigh?
-At Ieast a hunny.

303
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:52,922
-Maybe 1 1 0.
-Come on out and see us if you want.

304
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:56,679
-It's gonna be a good time.
-Yeah, I just might do that.

305
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,230
Hey, now. What you digging?

306
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:11,677
Some stuff in my grandpa's yard.

307
00:25:12,364 --> 00:25:15,299
I got a bigger one in the back
if you're going deep.

308
00:25:15,577 --> 00:25:17,807
No, this'II do.

309
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:22,499
Damn it if I don't know you
from somewhere.

310
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:23,959
Maybe I know your grandpa.

311
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:27,616
Doubt it, man.
He moved here Iike a month ago so....

312
00:25:27,668 --> 00:25:29,533
What's his name?

313
00:25:30,205 --> 00:25:34,107
His name's Grandpa, all right?
Can you just ring this up?

314
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:37,063
-I gotta get out of here.
-Sure thing, fella.

315
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:38,473
I'II ring it up.

316
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:41,043
I'II ring it right now.

317
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:46,530
I know where I've seen you. On TV.

318
00:25:46,352 --> 00:25:48,877
You're one of them Fox River boys.

319
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:14,824
-You got it wrong, man.
-No, I think I got it right.

320
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:18,488
We're closed.

321
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:29,628
Sorry, bud.

322
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:31,963
We're closing up early today.

323
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,995
Hey, hold on. Stay right there.

324
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:47,933
You're going down just Iike your buddy,
you son of a bitch.

325
00:26:53,471 --> 00:26:55,336
Where's the kid?

326
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:59,097
-Where's the kid?
-He's back here.

327
00:26:59,557 --> 00:27:01,024
Get up.

328
00:27:05,066 --> 00:27:06,693
Come on, tough guy.

329
00:27:06,897 --> 00:27:08,626
Let's go.

330
00:27:48,996 --> 00:27:51,794
Maricruz? Baby, open up.

331
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,859
It's me. It's me, okay?

332
00:27:57,556 --> 00:28:00,684
Fernando, what are you doing here?
You can't be here.

333
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,304
I know. Where's your sister?
I need to see her.

334
00:28:03,794 --> 00:28:06,092
She's getting her picture taken
with my mom and dad.

335
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:08,621
-The wedding's at 2:30.
-I need to see her now.

336
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,152
-You have to go.
-She's the mother of my kid, Theresa.

337
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:13,604
PIease.

338
00:28:13,623 --> 00:28:16,854
You don't want her
to marry Hector, do you? Do you?

339
00:28:20,474 --> 00:28:22,908
I'II go see if I can go get her.

340
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:26,453
-Wait in here.
-Okay.

341
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:42,748
-Lance, I got a question for you.
-Yes?

342
00:28:43,607 --> 00:28:45,404
You know who I am?

343
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,794
I happened to see the news
Iast night, yes.

344
00:28:54,158 --> 00:28:56,854
Hey, I don't care.
I've got some skeletons in my closet too.

345
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,985
One of whom wears a dress.

346
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:03,686
Thank you.
I appreciate your Iack of judgment.

347
00:29:03,772 --> 00:29:06,036
From what I can tell,
you didn't do anything wrong.

348
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:09,186
But it's none of my business,
and you don't need to talk about it.

349
00:29:09,228 --> 00:29:11,059
The whole thing just....

350
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:16,039
I never meant for it to happen.

351
00:29:18,883 --> 00:29:21,044
Okay, you do not need
to answer this question.

352
00:29:22,184 --> 00:29:25,745
But were you and that guy, Iike...?

353
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:32,064
You're right, I don't wanna talk about it.

354
00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:38,139
-You're done?
-Yeah.

355
00:29:38,182 --> 00:29:42,278
Does it worry you that he's out there?

356
00:29:44,744 --> 00:29:46,439
Give me one second.

357
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,088
-Dad.
-Sara, hi.

358
00:29:59,144 --> 00:30:01,078
I got your message.

359
00:30:01,118 --> 00:30:02,608
PIease, come in.

360
00:30:06,289 --> 00:30:09,554
Lance, this is my father, Frank.

361
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:11,680
-How do you do?
-Dad, this is my friend, Lance.

362
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:14,368
PIeasure to meet you, sir.
And I voted for you.

363
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,641
Thank you. I appreciate that.

364
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,266
-Sara, I can take off.
-No need.

365
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:21,267
Only take a minute.

366
00:30:21,568 --> 00:30:24,002
You step into my office.
And you make yourself at home.

367
00:30:23,812 --> 00:30:25,040
Sure.

368
00:30:34,924 --> 00:30:36,152
So....

369
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:41,347
So in my program, we've been talking
a Iot about making amends.

370
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:45,427
And I've been thinking a Iot about....

371
00:30:46,701 --> 00:30:49,761
About some of the choices
I've made Iately.

372
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:51,882
And I know that that affects you.

373
00:30:56,884 --> 00:31:00,183
And I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry.

374
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:03,648
-Well, you don't have to say you're sorry.
-Yeah, I do.

375
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:08,498
And it must be hard to understand
why I did it.

376
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:15,015
I had no idea that I was putting
these guys back out on the street.

377
00:31:14,746 --> 00:31:17,579
I thought I was saving the Iife
of an innocent man.

378
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:20,880
And I know that you didn't read
the information I gave you...

379
00:31:21,601 --> 00:31:24,900
...on Lincoln Burrows,
but he is innocent...

380
00:31:24,736 --> 00:31:27,500
...and a Iot of the people
involved right now are dead.

381
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:37,542
I'm sorry. This isn't why I called you.

382
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:40,518
I'm fine.

383
00:31:41,303 --> 00:31:43,203
But I'm scared.

384
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:47,063
Sara.

385
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:49,967
I'm gonna help you through this.

386
00:31:50,145 --> 00:31:52,739
We're gonna get through this together.

387
00:31:54,082 --> 00:31:57,176
-Thank you.
-I promise.

388
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:02,112
-Kellerman.
-We ran that trace you requested.

389
00:32:02,298 --> 00:32:04,858
-What'd you get?
-The line is disconnected.

390
00:32:04,444 --> 00:32:07,413
-And whose was it?
-Apparently no one.

391
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,743
-What does that mean?
-It's been out of service for 1 7 years.

392
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:20,095
Fernando.

393
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,015
-Where is she?
-Now, calm down. Calm down.

394
00:32:24,015 --> 00:32:26,006
She's gonna come down and talk to you.

395
00:32:27,027 --> 00:32:29,018
She's on her way down right now.

396
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:33,704
You and I got history. We're family.

397
00:32:34,198 --> 00:32:37,099
Out of respect for that,
I'm gonna Iet her make her own decision.

398
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:40,020
-I'm not Ieaving without her.
-That's for Maricruz to decide.

399
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:43,397
-You've been filling her head with this crap.
-She's a smart girl.

400
00:32:43,778 --> 00:32:46,872
I personally don't think she's gonna
wanna Iive her Iife on the run.

401
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:48,930
-We'II see.
-You know she doesn't Iove you.

402
00:32:48,888 --> 00:32:52,051
-I don't wanna get into that right now.
-You're not raising my kid.

403
00:32:59,822 --> 00:33:01,722
That don't sound good, cuz.

404
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,508
-Maricruz? Baby? Where is she?
-You have to go.

405
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,035
-Where is she?
-PIease. They're coming.

406
00:33:11,371 --> 00:33:14,602
Did you tell her I was here? Did you?

407
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:19,303
Maricruz.

408
00:33:50,676 --> 00:33:52,143
Mahone.

409
00:33:52,496 --> 00:33:54,464
I'II be right down.

410
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:03,561
-Mr. Mahone.
-Where are they?

411
00:34:03,653 --> 00:34:06,884
I had a hard time getting my hands
on these. Be easier to go to a doctor.

412
00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:08,778
You need something to calm your nerves.

413
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,375
Doctors take notes.
That's why I have a deal with you.

414
00:34:11,977 --> 00:34:14,741
The way things have been going,
I thought our deal was over.

415
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:17,545
-You don't ask me about Shales no more.
-That part is over.

416
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,018
I no Ionger need
an informant on the case.

417
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:23,221
I thought that's all you cared about,
was finding him.

418
00:34:23,816 --> 00:34:26,410
-Can't get them all.
-I can keep an ear out on the street--

419
00:34:26,228 --> 00:34:30,289
Midazolam, 1 500 milligrams every 30 days.
That's all I want from you.

420
00:34:31,928 --> 00:34:33,156
We understand each other?

421
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:37,393
You gonna pay me for it?

422
00:34:41,323 --> 00:34:42,881
Right there.

423
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:49,658
-What are you doing here?
-We had to come for you, buddy.

424
00:34:49,483 --> 00:34:52,043
-How'd you know?
-T-Bag.

425
00:34:52,306 --> 00:34:53,568
Hand over the map.

426
00:34:53,911 --> 00:34:55,173
-What?
-The map.

427
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,571
Hand it over.

428
00:34:58,734 --> 00:34:59,962
He told you I had it?

429
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,544
We are gonna sort this out right now.

430
00:35:26,405 --> 00:35:28,566
Tell me that's not what I know it is.

431
00:35:29,457 --> 00:35:31,755
It is. But don't worry.

432
00:35:33,178 --> 00:35:36,636
Before I destroyed it, I committed it
to my photographic memory.

433
00:35:35,776 --> 00:35:38,506
Coming from a compulsive Iiar,
I find that hard to believe.

434
00:35:38,018 --> 00:35:41,385
I'd have tattooed it to my body,
but I didn't have the time.

435
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:45,743
Whenever you strip-search a Iifer,
you should always check his coin purse.

436
00:35:46,235 --> 00:35:48,499
Tell us where the money is.

437
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,345
Now, Iet's not dissolve
into threats, all right?

438
00:35:51,311 --> 00:35:54,747
I'm gonna take the high road here.
Suggest a mutually beneficial arrangement.

439
00:35:54,746 --> 00:35:56,373
I have the information.

440
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,358
You have the manual requirements...

441
00:35:58,431 --> 00:36:01,298
...necessary to unearth
Westmoreland's buried booty.

442
00:36:01,704 --> 00:36:03,763
-We're partners.
-And why is that?

443
00:36:04,102 --> 00:36:06,969
Because as of this moment,
I'm your map.

444
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:15,422
So then, yo, we split it four ways, right?

445
00:36:16,178 --> 00:36:17,645
Wrong. Get in.

446
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:21,049
You're not worth 1.5.

447
00:36:20,976 --> 00:36:23,342
-Get in.
-Okay.

448
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:49,208
Excuse me. Can I help you?

449
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,833
Oh, yeah, sorry. Yeah.

450
00:36:55,979 --> 00:36:57,674
It's hot.

451
00:36:59,735 --> 00:37:02,966
I was really wondering how much
you're selling your RV for.

452
00:37:03,164 --> 00:37:06,565
-Probably out of your price range.
-Come on. Give me a shot.

453
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:08,720
Forty thousand dollars.

454
00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:16,437
Look, I tell you what.

455
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:18,729
I'II be back in a couple of days, okay?

456
00:37:19,048 --> 00:37:21,209
I can't hold it for you.

457
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:23,492
I said I'II be back.

458
00:37:23,474 --> 00:37:24,702
With cash.

459
00:37:43,584 --> 00:37:45,313
Nice bike.

460
00:37:54,177 --> 00:37:56,907
The wedding's at 2:30, Fernando.

461
00:37:59,726 --> 00:38:01,887
We just got confirmation
on Fernando Sucre.

462
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,679
He was in Las Vegas around 2.

463
00:38:03,818 --> 00:38:05,410
Then a gas station attendant...

464
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:10,405
...spotted a guy on a bike matching
his description in Mesquite...

465
00:38:08,388 --> 00:38:10,982
...an hour Iater.

466
00:38:14,413 --> 00:38:16,779
Out west. Just Iike Bagwell and Franklin.

467
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,361
Yeah, but he was heading east...

468
00:38:18,582 --> 00:38:20,880
...and Bagwell's in Nebraska
on I-80 heading west...

469
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,491
...and Franklin's train was heading west,
but he jumped off to the....

470
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:33,807
-You know D.B. Cooper?
-Yeah, the hijacker.

471
00:38:33,946 --> 00:38:36,380
-But he was never found.
-But he's gotta be somewhere.

472
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:39,976
Someone hijacked that plane in Portland and
jumped out over the Pacific Northwest...

473
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:44,412
...and someone was arrested
two days Iater in Bisbee, Arizona.

474
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:46,233
-Not the same guy.
-Same guy.

475
00:38:46,275 --> 00:38:48,266
Same guy who was treated
for a broken knee...

476
00:38:48,698 --> 00:38:50,996
...at a free clinic
somewhere around Salt Lake City.

477
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:53,868
Same guy whose Nova blew a head gasket
1 0 miles short of the border.

478
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:56,969
Same guy who almost got away
with a stolen car...

479
00:38:57,529 --> 00:38:59,463
...but he ran a woman down in Bisbee.

480
00:38:59,377 --> 00:39:01,004
Vehicular manslaughter.

481
00:39:01,392 --> 00:39:05,123
Arrested and booked
as Charles Westmoreland.

482
00:39:06,198 --> 00:39:07,859
But he didn't have the money on him.

483
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:09,724
Which means...

484
00:39:09,788 --> 00:39:11,813
...he got rid of it
somewhere along the way.

485
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:15,966
-This is fact? You figured all this out?
-No, Scofield did.

486
00:39:16,137 --> 00:39:18,799
That's why he was bringing the old man.
The money's in Utah.

487
00:39:19,068 --> 00:39:21,434
And they're all going to get it.

488
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:28,467
You know, in Thailand,
they got a black market...

489
00:39:28,503 --> 00:39:31,495
...where you can get any surgery
you need, even a hand transplant.

490
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:33,546
You're sick, you know that?

491
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:35,710
Keep going.
The turnoff's just up here somewhere.

492
00:39:35,894 --> 00:39:38,522
Before or after Sheep Road?

493
00:39:39,964 --> 00:39:41,488
What's the matter? Did you forget?

494
00:39:41,684 --> 00:39:44,517
How could I forget a road called Sheep?
It's after.

495
00:39:44,528 --> 00:39:47,326
Don't you feel all warm inside
now that we're working together?

496
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:51,117
We aren't working together.
You're just here to Iend a hand.

497
00:39:50,913 --> 00:39:55,407
Wait, wait, slow down. That was it.
That Iittle bitty road right back there.

498
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:20,095
How far is it from here?

499
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:23,866
A quarter mile,
if I remember the scale properly.

500
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:25,356
Let's start walking.

501
00:40:46,167 --> 00:40:49,625
-Frank?
-Yeah, I'm almost ready.

502
00:40:49,804 --> 00:40:52,500
-What time did you say the flight was?
-Eight.

503
00:40:52,498 --> 00:40:56,659
Listen, I hope you get this nomination
more than anyone, but be prepared.

504
00:40:57,061 --> 00:40:58,790
This Burrows thing may steamroll.

505
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:03,339
-Well, we'II wait it out, just Iike you said.
-Problem is too many headlines.

506
00:41:03,158 --> 00:41:05,149
His Iawyer, Nick Savrinn, is already dead.

507
00:41:05,602 --> 00:41:07,661
His kid's awaiting trial
for double homicide...

508
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:10,256
...and now his Iead counsel
is classified as missing.

509
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:13,270
Well, is she missing or is she dead?

510
00:41:13,941 --> 00:41:16,637
I just thought you should know
before you go to Washington.

511
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,631
Bruce, is there something
connecting all of this?

512
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:23,291
It's probably best you don't ask
a whole Iot of questions.

513
00:41:33,756 --> 00:41:35,553
Where now?

514
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:39,097
Right up there.

515
00:41:39,787 --> 00:41:42,415
The hill borders the property.

516
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:44,279
The K.K. is on the other side.

517
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,999
First thing I'm gonna do
with the money:

518
00:41:46,998 --> 00:41:49,364
-Buy new shoes.
-Second thing, tacos.

519
00:41:49,476 --> 00:41:51,967
Third thing, ice-cold beer.

520
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:55,722
Fourth thing, a Iittle toothpaste.

521
00:42:11,825 --> 00:42:14,919
-Mahone.
-Agent Mahone, your car's out front, sir.

522
00:42:15,002 --> 00:42:19,666
-The flight to Utah leaves in an hour.
-I'II be there. Thank you.

523
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:48,029
Ninth thing, a shower.

524
00:42:48,077 --> 00:42:53,014
-Tenth thing, a good night's sleep.
-A nice hotel. CIean sheets.

525
00:42:53,334 --> 00:42:57,634
Look, stakes marking the property Iine.
Should be dead ahead.

526
00:42:58,797 --> 00:43:01,027
Can you see the silo?

527
00:43:07,149 --> 00:43:09,344
The bastards built over it.

528
00:43:11,512 --> 00:43:12,911
It's gone.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
